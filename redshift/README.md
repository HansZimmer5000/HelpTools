# Redshift

The script sets the configuration in this folder.
Currently redshift is active all day.

## Update the configuration

To update the configuration set the values in the local 'redshit.conf' file and execute 'set_setting.sh'. This will replace the current redshift configuration at the default location '~/.config/redshift/redshift.conf'

After that restart (or maybe logout/login works also) so that redshift starts with the new configuration.
