# Backups

Currently, I have two external 1 TB HDDs, both are synced by hand which of course is a tedious and error prone task. So now I am in the search of a tool to automate:
- comparison of the Backup states on each HDD
- sync updated files to other HDD

Also, the tool might provide a form of compression and update of compressed files, so I need less space on the hard drives. This OK as the backups are very really used.

## Possible Tools:
- `rsync`
-
